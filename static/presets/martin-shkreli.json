The assessment, based on 41 sources spanning legal filings, regulatory records, mainstream and financial media, and academic references, reveals a history marked by securities fraud, regulatory violations, and public scandal. Shkreli's conduct\u2014most notably his conviction for securities fraud and the infamous Daraprim price hike\u2014has led to lasting criminal, civil, and reputational consequences. These outcomes are compounded by his lifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry and ongoing federal monitoring.\n\nThe most significant findings include Shkreli\u2019s conviction and imprisonment for securities fraud (U.S. v. Shkreli, 15-cr-637), his central role in price gouging for Daraprim at Turing Pharmaceuticals, and his subsequent exclusion from pharmaceutical operations by the FTC. The implications are profound: any potential business relationship with Shkreli carries risks of regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, and possible future legal exposure. His operational decisions have led to bankruptcies, lawsuits, and regulatory action, while his public persona as \"Pharma Bro\" remains a symbol of industry malfeasance.\n\nA critical timeline traces his ascent from hedge fund manager to pharmaceutical executive, the rapid accumulation of legal challenges, and the dramatic collapse of his career following federal investigations. Major red flags include repeated instances of dishonesty, misrepresentation to investors, failures in corporate governance, and a pattern of associating with controversial individuals and entities. These concerns are substantiated by court documents, regulatory findings, and extensive media coverage.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supports a recommendation of **extreme caution** and a strong advisory against any business engagement with Martin Shkreli. The risks are not only historical but ongoing, as his supervised release and industry bans underscore his continued monitoring by federal authorities. The total risk score of 91/100 reflects both the severity and likelihood of adverse outcomes, with few if any effective mitigation factors.\n\n---\n\n## Background & Profile\n\n### Personal Information\n\n- **Full Name:** Martin Shkreli\n- **Date of Birth:** March 17, 1983\n- **Education:** \n  - **Baruch College (CUNY):** Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Finance, Graduated 2004\n\n### Early Career & Formative Experiences\n\n- Grew up in Brooklyn, New York, child of Albanian and Croatian immigrants.\n- Interned at Cramer, Berkowitz & Co. during college, focusing on hedge fund analysis and short selling.\n- Joined Intrepid Capital Management (Analyst, 2004\u20132005), then moved to UBS Wealth Management (Analyst, 2005\u20132006).\n\n### Professional History\n\n- **Elea Capital Management (2006\u20132007):** Co-founder, focused on biotech investments.

His history of fraud, regulatory violations, and public scandal creates legal, financial, and reputational liabilities that are ongoing and severe. No engagement is recommended.\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Sources Consulted\n\n- PACER.gov (case 15-cr-637, 1:17-cv-01266)\n- Justice.gov (press releases, sentencing memo)\n- FTC.gov (Vyera Pharmaceuticals consent decree)\n- SEC.gov (filings, enforcement actions)\n- NY Times, WSJ, Bloomberg, Forbes, Stat News (news coverage)\n- Baruch College (education verification)\n- OpenCorporates, Crunchbase (company filings)\n- Social media (Twitter, Instagram)\n- Wikipedia (profile, timeline)\n\n### Key Legal Documents Referenced\n\n- U.S. v.
